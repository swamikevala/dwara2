Some Sadhguru quotes

There is only one problem in the world - The Human Being.
No matter how many things you gather in life, there is no container service in the end. Time to move from accumulation to true enhancement of life.
If you do not do what you cannot do, it is all right. But if you do not do what you can do, your life is a tragedy.
Do not hold back your love, your joy, and your exuberance. Only what you give becomes your quality, not what you hold back.
If you are constantly aware of your mortal nature, you will only do what truly matters.

Constantly seek that which you know to be the highest. Living with the vision is an elevating experience and a joyous process in itself.
